# smtpBrute
Simple smtp auth brute forcer.  Runs in parallel so should be pretty fast.  Haven't tested anything yet.

## Installation
1. Install go
2. `go get -u github.com/lespea/smtpBrute`
3. smtpBrute should be in your path; you may need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your path (default is `home/go/bin`

## Update
1. `go get -u github.com/lespea/smtpBrute`
